# Mathematical Mysteries: Detective Framework for Number Adventures

*Where Math Meets Mystery and Every Problem is a Case to Solve*

-----

## 🔍 The Core Philosophy

**Big Idea:** Every mathematical concept is actually a mystery waiting to be solved. Numbers leave clues, patterns hide secrets, and mathematical relationships are like detective cases waiting for young sleuths to crack them.

**Nature Detectives:** Our nature teachers become mathematical mystery-solving partners, each with special detective skills for different types of numerical cases.
