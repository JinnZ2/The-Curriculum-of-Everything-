# CogniSpeak: A Cognitive Language for Kids’ AI Interaction

*Teaching Children to “Think Out Loud” with AI Partners*

-----

## 🧠 The Core Concept

**Vision:** Create a structured yet natural language system that helps children express their thinking processes, learning needs, and cognitive goals when interacting with AI.

**Why This Matters:** Kids need a way to communicate not just WHAT they want to know, but HOW they think, WHAT they’re struggling with, and WHERE they want to grow cognitively.

**Nature Inspiration:** Just like animals have specific communication patterns for different situations (danger calls, food alerts, play signals), kids need cognitive communication patterns for learning, creating, and problem-solving with AI.
